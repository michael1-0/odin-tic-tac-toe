# odin-tic-tac-toe
This project is an assignment for The Odin Project Full Stack Javascript path, I am tasked to build Tic Tac Toe logic using factory functions and module patterns like IIFEs. This is a tic tac toe of 2 people, to start the game is simple, a user will need to click the start button and input their names to play the button; once submit, the DOM will update, showing a board that player 1 and player 2 need to update, each with their corresponding signature move: player one will receive 'X' and player 2 will receive 'O' as their signature moves. Once completed, user can have the chance to play the game again, with the same names as before, or a new pair of names.
